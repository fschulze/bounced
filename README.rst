bounced
=======

A library to determine info on bounced email messages.


Why another one?
----------------

With `flufl.bounce`_ one only gets a list of email addresses without any further info.
The API of `bounce_email`_ isn't Pythonic and inefficient for several use cases, like when you already have email message objects.
