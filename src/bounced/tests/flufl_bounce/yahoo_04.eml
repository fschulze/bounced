I need this mainly for tracing purposes in spots where I have no knowledge 
of the current instance of thread. This does not seem to help me in that
case.

It is however possible to provide a class threadid, that has dependent on
the
platform different members but provides operations as ==, !=, 
operator<<(ostream&, ), ... That would be fine to solve the problem.

As a substitute, try using the comparison operator for the boost::thread
class.  This can fill the gap in many (but not all) cases where you are
managing the set of threads yourself.

On some platforms (i.e. pthreads), the "thread_id" is actually an opaque
type (pthread_t) rather than a numeric value, and I think that is why no
such operation is exposed in the current version of the library.

Dave
