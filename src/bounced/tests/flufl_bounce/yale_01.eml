 --------Message not delivered to the following:

 thomas.dtankengine    No matches to nameserver query

 --------Error Detail (phquery V4.1):

 The message, "No matches to nameserver query," is generated whenever
 Yale's on-line directory fails to locate either a ph alias, name or
 nickname field that matches the supplied name.  The usual causes are
 typographical errors.  Recommended action is to query the Yale on-line
 directory prior to mailing using the ``ph -s directory.yale.edu NAME'',
 ``finger NAME@directory.yale.edu'', or equivalent commands, or by
 querying the Yale Directory within YaleInfo, where NAME is your party's
 name, email alias, or nickname.  If no lookup tools are available to
 you, try sending to the most explicit form of the name, e.g., if
 mike.fox@yale.edu fails, try michael.j.fox@yale.edu.
 
 To reach a party that was formerly reachable by emailing NAME@yale.edu,
 try emailing to NAME@cs.yale.edu instead.

If the rpm was compiled for RH 7 then its probably set to apache.  If not, 
you need to find the src rpm and rebuild it using the --rebuilddb option.
You'll need to pass in new options or change the spec file.

Ok, but It can be used by anyone, so a list member can modify the
administrative options.

 If it's a feature, I don't understand it.

Hang on, I mis-read that as "The Administrator password ...".
Their -name-?  You mean their email address?  There isn't
anywhere in mailman that their name is used ....

I believe the underlying code is trying to clean up any possibly pre-existing lock file
as part of the "taking care" section when creating a list.  There's no known live lock 
file for the list because the list is being created now, and this code is just a 
prophylactic measure to try to make newlist more bulletproof.  The fact
that you didn't have permission would be a fatal error for either creating or
removing a lock, so dying if it happens is not unreasonable.

It is a bit confusing, but it's part of trying to make the filesystem persistence
less of a problem.

??  You said, correctly, the administrator password can be used as password to go
change users' options.  That's not at all true in the reverse; user passwords don't
get you admin privileges.

Think of the admin password like the "root" user password; you can do more with it.
And the site password works for even more things (for admin privs on any list, 
for example).

Subject: [Mailman-Users] Mailman 2.0 with Python 2.0

Mailman seems to be continually retrying sending mail to hosts 
which can't be resolved via the DNS.  Is this correct?

Also why is it that Mailman seems to invoke sendmail in such a 
way that it causes sendmail to return a failure on hostnames that 
can't be resolved (presumably a temporary condition) rather than 
just passing the message to sendmail and letting sendmail do all 
the retries itself (which is how most mailers invoke sendmail).  I 
imagine this must relate to the program's needing more detailed 
info about the state of each message to be sent, but when you tie 
this in with the default frequency of its retries, it's very strange.

Subject: [Mailman-Users] Recovering/resetting a list admin password

I lost the email giving me my list admin password for one list.  The site 
admin claims that there is no way to either recover or reset that password, 
and that I have to recreate the list.  Is that true, or can he use the site 
admin password to get access to the list administrative page and reset the 
password that way?  It looks to me from the documentation that he should be 
able to.

Thanks,
Jim Trigg

There is a list about ethiopia maintained or adminstered or otherwise
related to your operations.

People are being added to this list without having any knowledge of it. They
are given passwords they don't know. They cannot, therefore, remove
themsleves. I am such a person.

Perhaps this is ignorance, more likely a stupid but venal undertaking, At
any rate, you should immediately shut down this list and inform those
attempting to create it of proper procedures.

Thank you.
