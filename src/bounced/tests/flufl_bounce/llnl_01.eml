>wxPython 2.3.0 is now available for download.  Unfortunately the shell
>server at sourceforge is down for a few days and so I can't update the
>wxPython.org web page, but in the meantime you can get the files directly
>from
>
>http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10718.
>
>Sources and binaries for win32 and Linux for Python 1.5.2, 2.0 and 2.1 are
>available.  (The win32 binaries with "-hybrid" in the name are built with
>extra debugging code enabled so some things that caused mysterious problems
>before will now pop-up a slightly less mysterious message dialog.)
>
>There have been a large number of changes for this release.  I'll include
>the relevant portion of CHANGES.txt here:
>
>
>
>Removed initial startup dependency on the OpenGL DLLs so only the
>glcanvasc.pyd depends on them, (on wxMSW.)
>
>Changed wxFont, wxPen, wxBrush to not implicitly use the
>wxThe[Font|Pen|Brush]List objects behind the scenes, but to use normal
>ctor and dtors.
>
>Exposed the wxThe[Font|Pen|Brush]List to wxPython.
>
>Also added wxTheColourDatabase and added a library module (in the
>wxPython.lib.colourdb module) to load LOTS more colour names into the
>colour database.
>
>Added wxWakeUpMainThread, wxMutexGuiEnter, wxMutexGuiLeave,
>wxMutexGuiLocker and wxThread_IsMain to assist with dealing with GUI
>access from non-GUI threads.
>
>wxPyOnDemandOutputWindow is now (more) thread safe if non-GUI threads
>use print, sys.stdout.write, etc.
>
>Added CreateTextSizer and CreateButtonSizer to wxDialog
>
>Added wxPython/lib/infoframe.py from Chris Fama.  It contains a class
>that can be used in place of wxPyOnDemandOutputWindow.
>
>Added colourselect.py, imagebrowser.py and an updated calendar.py to
>wxPython/lib from Lorne White.
>
>Added patch to wxPoint_LIST_helper from Tim Hochberg that should make
>it gobs faster in certain situations.
>
>Added tools that will take an image file in a wx supported format and
>convert it to data embedded in a Python source file.  The image is
>converted to XPM format which is essentially a list of strings
>containing info about each pixel.  The image's transparency mask is
>included, if there is one, or a mask can be added if a mask colour is
>specified on the command line.  It is then pickled and optionally
>compressed and written to a Python source file along with functions to
>convert it to either a wxBitmap or a wxImage.  See
>wxPython/demo/images.py for examples, and wxPython/Tools/img2py.py for
>the implementation.
>
>Fixed wxStyledTextCtrl to be much faster on wxGTK.  There was some
>experimental code that got left in place that ended up causing way too
>many refreshes.
>
>A couple more hacks in my_distutils.py so wxPython can be built with
>the distutils that comes with Python 2.1.
>
>Added a ton of missing methods for wxPrintData.
>
>Switched to InnoSetup for MSW distributions.
>
>Added wxToggleButton.
>
>Fixed bug that prevented wxTreeCtrl.OnCompareItems from being called.
>
>Added some methods to wxGrid:
>      GetCellHighlightPenWidth
>      GetCellHighlightROPenWidth
>      SetCellHighlightPenWidth
>      SetCellHighlightROPenWidth
>      GetGridWindow
>      GetGridRowLabelWindow
>      GetGridColLabelWindow
>      GetGridCornerLabelWindow
>
>Added wxGetClientDisplayRect which on wxMSW returns a wxRect
>representing the area on screen not occupied by the taskbar and such.
>On other platforms it is equivallent to wxGetDisplaySize.
>

>   Implemented the first phase of OOR (Original Object Return).  See
>   the text in the demo for more details of what this means, but in a
>   nutshell methods such as wxWindow.GetParent or FindWindowById will
>   now return a shadow object of the proper type if it can.  By
>   "proper type" I mean that if the wxWindow pointer returned from
>   FindWindowById really points to a wxButton then the Python object
>   constructed will be of a wxButtonPtr class instead of wxWindowPtr
>   as before.  This should reduce or eliminiate the need for
>   wxPyTypeCast.  (Woo Hoo!)  The objects returned are still not the
>   original Python object, but that is the next step.  (Although it
