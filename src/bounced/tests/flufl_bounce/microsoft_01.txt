OK, one more time...slowly:

Youngsters like Berry, Meloche and TK are no longer exempt from regular 
season waivers. Hence, they'd have to pass through waivers to be sent down 
to WBS.

Now, during the waiver draft, to claim a player you must also unprotect one 
of your own players. This is different from the regular waivers, where any 
team can claim any player without giving up anything but the waiver fee. 
This means teams are more reluctant to claim guys, since they run the risk 
of losing one of their own players.

However, if a player was to pass through the waiver draft *unclaimed*, he 
would also count as having passed regular waivers -- and then be allowed to 
be sent down immidiately. This was most definitely Patrick's reasoning for 
Meloche and TK -- he said as much yesterday -- and probably also for Berry; 
ie. management wanted them playing in the minors, and this was the best 
chance of getting them there. The only other option would be to keep them 
on the big team for the entire season.

Also, if Washington ever wants to send Berry down, they must put him 
through waivers, where the Pens have the option of claiming him back -- and 
would then, as the original owning team, be free to send him down to THEIR 
minor club without putting him on waivers (NHL CBA, article 13.20, I
believe).

Personally, I think this whole Rick Berry issue has been totally blown out 
of proportion. It's not like he's the second coming of Ray Bourque or even 
Scott Stevens. He's a borderline NHL:er who probably would've played out 
most of the season in the minors anyway (seeing as how Penguins management 
weren't too high on him after camp). While I can't say I feel content to 
lose one asset of the Kasparaitis trade already, the reasoning behind this 
move is sound, and all you Pittsburgh/Mario/CP-bashers are really making a 
chicken out of a feather here.
