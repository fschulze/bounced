Hi New to the List.   Just curious.  What would you have the government do instead?    I see alot of passion over this topic so I assume you have an alternative to Ashcroft.     These are tough times, and call for quick and concise thinking, Gov is doing its best, Do we have anything better in mind that can be implemented in a short amount of time like this is.?
