Thank you for registering for the Grizzly Peak Century in 2005 - we'd
like to see you again! Once again our favorite rolling feast takes
place on the first Sunday in May - the 7th. We've tweaked the route a
little bit, we're including a great GPC Water Bottle for each rider,
and more. But we've still got the fantastic food, the beautiful Bay
Area vistas, and a wonderful time. More information is available on
our website at <http://www.GrizzlyPeakCyclists.org/century>.

Registration opens on February 5, 2006. You can fill-out and print an
application from our website, or you can register "instantly" for
about 3 bucks through Active.com at
<http://www.active.com/event_detail.cfm?event_id=1283704>. And if you
really want a paper flyer, reply to this email with your address, and
we'll mail you one.

We hope to see you again!

- Jeff Kurtock

Century Chair
